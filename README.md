# Complete Translation 

This project is to translate a document to another language. The initial target is English to Korean. Consider this project is not a whole, but there could be other projects to support this. For instance, the main aim of this project is to inject translated text while preserving the styles into the original document in interleaving manner. It calls APIs to get translated text from NMT(Neural Machine Translation) service. The other project could provide MLOps codebase for NMT, then the endpoint created by that one can be used in this project.
